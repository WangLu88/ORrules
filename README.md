This folder contains R code for estimating and making inference about the incremental value of a new biomarker when combined with an established biomarker using an OR rule as proposed in the paper “Assessing the incremental value of new biomarkers based on OR rules” by Lu Wang, Alexander R Luedtke and Ying Huang. 


"ORruleExample.R" contains an example R code for estimating and making inference about the incremental value using a fuzzy p-value based approach and the bootstrap based approached.

"gettheta_1.0.tar.gz" includes a R package built for finding the maximizers in the threshold using the grid search method.
